Created this for myself but maybe someone could find this usefull too.

# How to use
Download it [here](https://github.com/Kevin-De-Koninck/Swift-Regex-Tester/releases/download/v1.0.0/Swift.Regex.Tester.app.zip) and copy it to your application folder. Then open the app.
You can look in the code to see how I process the regex (that you can use too in your code).
